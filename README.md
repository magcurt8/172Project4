Project 4
Name: Margaret M. Curtis
Partner: Scott Onestak

Short Description:
Program that runs based on command line arguments. If the argument desires a meridian path(kruskal’s) through the ur campus, it will output the graph GUI and show the MWST on the map in a colored line. The console will print out the roads traveled in order. If the argument desires the shortest path (dijkstras), it will output a GUI with the proper map and the shortest path between the two given points with a different colored line. The console will print out the intersections in order and the total distance traveled in miles. 

Directions for running code:
Code can be run in Eclipse
Code can be run in Terminal
cd Desktop 
javac Test.java
example command line arguments:
for Kruskal’s: ur_campus.txt -show -meridianmap
for Dijkstra’s: nys.txt -show -directions i0 i200
