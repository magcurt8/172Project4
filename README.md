Project 3
Partner: Scott Onestak

Short Description:
Program that creates a binary search tree of lines. It calculates the average path length of the tree and the number of external nodes. It also shows a GUI where the user can select two points on the graph and it will determine whether or not the points are in the same region, or if they are in different regions, which line separates them. 

Directions for running code:
Code can be run in Eclipse
Code can be run in Terminal
cd Desktop 
javac Test.java
java Test

Expected Source Output (clicked two points in GUI):

Average height of a tree: 13
Number of external nodes: 6
Points 0.24 0.18 and 0.64 0.24 are in the same region
Points 0.96 0.30 and 0.91 0.39 are in the same region
Points 0.96 0.98 and 0.81 0.64 are in the same region
Points 0.33 0.92 and 0.47 0.76 are in the same region
Points 0.04 0.62 and 0.09 0.89 are in the same region
Points 0.19 0.99 and 0.26 0.74 are separated by line 0.0 0.12 0.23 1.0
Points 0.08 0.82 and 0.18 0.31 are separated by line 0.0 0.12 0.23 1.0
Points 0.38 0.85 and 0.79 0.47 are separated by line 0.3 1.0 0.7966804979253111 0.4323651452282158
Points 0.92 0.60 and 0.93 0.32 are separated by line 0.0 0.52 0.10162377112559375 0.5088213851761847
Points 0.98 0.39 and 0.86 0.28 are separated by line 1.0 0.2 0.7966804979253111 0.4323651452282158
