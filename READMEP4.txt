Short Description:
Program that runs based on command line arguments. If the argument desires a meridian path(kruskalâ€™s) through the ur campus, it will output the graph GUI and show the MWST on the map in a colored line. The console will print out the roads traveled in order. If the argument desires the shortest path (dijkstras), it will output a GUI with the proper map and the shortest path between the two given points with a different colored line. The console will print out the intersections in order and the total distance traveled in miles.
